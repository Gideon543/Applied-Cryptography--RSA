# Applied-Cryptography--RSA

In this task, we implement the textbook version of RSA-n, where n represents the bit size of primes used in the key computation for the algorithm. We break the discussion of the implementation into five phases: key computation, encryption, the decryption schemes, implementation of algorithm, and tests.
