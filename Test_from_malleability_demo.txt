RSA-5 IMPLEMENTATION 

==================== 

Bob selects 12 as a key and encrypts it using Alice's public key (E = 65537, N = 551) 

Bob attempts to send his ciphertext, 331, to Alice 

Mallory intercepts and replaces Bob's ciphertext with 239, which she computes by using Alice's public key to encrypt her key, 45 

When Alice decrypts Mallory's cipher, she gets 45, which is the same as Mallory's key, 45
